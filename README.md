In this repository I will be adding my solutions to the Logical Foundations exercises.

On my computer I am using CoqIDE.

For general Coq exercises see https://github.com/bor0/tutorials/tree/master/2017/coq.

The same exercises (should) have a corresponding code written in Idris. You can check my book on Dependent Types and Idris: https://leanpub.com/gidti/
